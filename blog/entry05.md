for my tool a-frame i learn how to build things with blocks like a tree and also made it kind of to look like minecraft by adding pics to match the texture i wanted to have for each things. another things i learn was how to change the sky in to a kind of more realistic instead of it just being a certain color.Another thing i learned was how to add a bar showing you what your fps is, but im still trying to figure out how to make it show forever and not just while loading the page.
Right now all im trying to learn is how to add more things like controls and make it look better.
